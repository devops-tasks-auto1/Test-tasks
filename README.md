**Devops assesment test**

This is my answers for devops position in Auto1 Germany. Each task is inside it's own directory.
I found this tasks inside suspicious process running yum-updatesd,  which is RedHat/CentOS yum packet manager update notifier tool, but the test system is Debian 8. They are coded with base64 format.
